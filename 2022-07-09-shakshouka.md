# Shakshouka

## Ingredients 

- 1⁄2 tsp cumin seeds 6 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 190ml light olive oil or vegetable oil
- 2 large onions, peeled and sliced
- 2 red and 2 yellow peppers, cored and cut into 2cm strips
- 4 tsp muscovado sugar
- 6 sprigs thyme, picked and chopped 
- 2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley, chopped
- 1 bunch fresh coriander, chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- 1⁄2 tsp saffron strands
- Pinch of cayenne pepper
- Up to 250ml water
- 8 free-range eggs

## Steps
- In a large saucepan, dry-roast the cumin on high heat for two minutes.
- Add the oil and sauté the onions for two minutes.
- Add the peppers, sugar, bay leaves, thyme, parsley and two tablespoons of coriander, and cook on
high heat to get a nice colour.
- Add the tomatoes, saffron, cayenne, salt and pepper. Cook on low heat for 15 minutes, adding
enough water to keep it the consistency of a pasta sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning. It
should be potent and flavoursome. You can prepare this mix in advance.
- Place four saucepans on medium heat and divide the mixture between them. Break two eggs into
each pan, pouring into gaps in the mixture. Sprinkle with salt, cover and cook very gently for
10-12 minutes, until the egg just sets.
- Sprinkle with coriander and serve with chunky white bread.
- Enjoy!
