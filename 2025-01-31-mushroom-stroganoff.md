# Mushroom stroganoff

## Ingredients 

- 15g dried mushrooms (we like porcini mushrooms), roughly chopped
- olive oil
- 1 onion, finely diced
- 2 garlic cloves, diced
- 500g mixed mushrooms (we like a mixture of oyster and button mushrooms)
- 1 tablespoon brown rice miso paste
- 2 tablespoons almond butter
- 1 x 400g tin of coconut milk
- 20g chives, finely chopped
- salt

## Steps

1. Place the dried mushrooms in a bowl and cover with about 150ml of boiling water - you want the mushrooms to be submerged. Leave to soak for about 20 minutes.

2. While they soak, place a large saucepan over a medium heat and add a drizzle of olive oil. Once warm, add the onion and garlic and a pinch of salt and cook for 5-10 minutes, until soft.

3. As they cook, thinly slice the fresh mushrooms. Once the onions have softened and are starting to brown, add the fresh mushrooms to the pan and let them cook together for 10 minutes, until the mushrooms have softened.

4. At this point, add the miso and almond butter, stir them through before adding the coconut milk, dried mushrooms and the water that the dried mushrooms had been soaking in. Give everything a good stir and bring to the boil before reducing the heat and leaving to simmer for 20 minutes.

5. Once you are ready to serve, stir through the chives, reserving a small amount for the top. You may want to add a dash of hot water if the stew is too thick. Serve in bowls scattered with some of the reserved chives.
