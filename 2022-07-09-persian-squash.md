   -2 fresh red chillies
   -1 stick of cinnamon
   -1⁄2 a bunch of fresh thyme
   -1 pinch of turmeric
   -2 x 400g / 14 oz tins of plum tomatoes
   -1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar

## Steps
- Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas 4. Grease a 24cm diameter loose-bottomed tart tin with a
little olive oil.
- Peel, deseed and chop the squash into 1cm chunks, then toss onto a baking tray with a drizzle of
oil and sea salt and black pepper, and roast for 20 to 25 minutes.
- Peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic, and roughly chop the apricots and cranberries. Bash
the cumin and coriander seeds and zest the lemon. Pick and roughly chop the coriander, then
roughly chop the chestnuts.
- In a frying pan over a medium heat, cook the onion in a little oil for 10 minutes or until soft and
sweet. Add the garlic and cook for another minute or so, until beginning to soften, then add all the
spices and a little more oil. Cook for a couple more minutes, until it's all smelling great. Remove
from the heat and set aside.
- Blitz the pistachios and almonds to a coarse powder with a little texture. Tip into a bowl with the
quinoa or rice and dried fruit, then add the lemon zest, coriander and chestnuts. Beat and stir in
the eggs (or chia seed mix) and the onion.
- Take the squash out of the oven and mash half of it with the back of a fork, leaving the other half
in chunks, then stir this into the mixture too.
- Put the mixture into the prepared tin and press down to flatten. Cook in the oven for 45 to 50
minutes, or until set.
- While it's cooking, make the tomato sauce. Peel and chop the garlic and onion. Place a large
saucepan over a medium heat. Prick the chillies and add to the pan with a little oil, the cinnamon
stick, sprigs of thyme, garlic, onion and turmeric.
- Cook for a minute or two, then add the plum tomatoes. Fill the tin with water and pour that in too,
stirring to break up the tomatoes. Season with salt, stir through the balsamic vinegar and bring to
the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
- Once the sauce is thick and glossy, pick out the chilli, cinnamon and thyme. Set aside.
- Take the nut roast out of the oven, then carefully remove it from the tin, slice and serve with the
sauce.
- Enjoy!
